# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Tikita Tolley** â€“ a tech wizard in training and building apps online; I'm currently living in Chiang Mai, Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ for a year.

I mainly build GPTs, HubSpot and Shopify apps, the aim being to *solve real problems without all the technical jargon*.  

Before we left the UK, my husband and I co-founded [Daeda Technologies PTE. LTD.](https://daeda.tech) and we now have 3 apps on the [hubspot marketplace](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/daeda-essentials) - our [4th](https://www.daeda.tech/projects/auto-association-pro) just about to join them!
